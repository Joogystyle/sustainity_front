# Sustainity â€“ Sustainability Dashboard ðŸŒ±

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

To run the project locally:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
npm install
npm run dev
```
## ðŸ“Š Overview

1. **Upload Page**  
   - Users can upload a CSV file and preview the first 10 rows of the dataset.  
   - After uploading, users can click the **"Visualize"** button to navigate to the visualization page.

2. **Visualization Page**  
   - A sidebar is available on the left side, where users can:
     - âœ… Select which columns to display in the data table  
     - ðŸ”ƒ Choose a column to sort by  
     - ðŸ”¼ Select the sort order (ascending or descending)  
     - ðŸ¥§ Pick a column to visualize as a **Pie Chart** based on value frequency  
   - users can click **"Showtime!!"** to generate the filtered table and chart.

## Challenges I Faced
- I hadnâ€™t been coding or building websites for the past 3 months, so I had to refresh a lot of things I previously knew.

- I had never visualized data in a frontend app before, so working with Chart.js and integrating it was completely new for me.

- Handling dynamic CSV uploads with unknown structure was a big challenge. I needed a flexible and general approach to work with any dataset users might upload.

## My Approach
I started by using AI to help scaffold the initial base, and then I revised and customized each part by myself.

I broke the project down into small, manageable components:

- UploadCSV component
- PieChart component
- Sidebar for filtering and sorting

For data visualization, I came up with a general idea: count the frequency of values in a selected column and display them in a Pie Chart. This works well across different datasets.

I used Next.js with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind and shadcn/ui, and handled CSV parsing using PapaParse.
